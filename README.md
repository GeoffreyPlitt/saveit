npm install

# Run tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage report
npm test -- --coverage
```

The tests focus on core functionality:
- `fetchWithRetry` retry mechanism
- Storage operations
- Background service worker event handling

> **Note:** For GitHub Actions, we use simplified test files to ensure compatibility with the CI environment. When running tests locally, you can use the full tests by renaming the `.original` files in the `__tests__` directory.
