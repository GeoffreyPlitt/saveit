### Testing Tools

For testing webhook functionality, we recommend using [postb.in](https://www.postb.in) - a free tool for creating short-lived disposable webhooks. It shows you all requests it receives, making it perfect for testing the extension's webhook integration without setting up your own server.

Simply:
1. Visit https://www.postb.in and create a new bin
2. Copy the provided webhook URL
3. Use it in the extension's options page
4. Test the extension and view the received requests on postb.in

### Testing

We use Jest for unit testing with Docker to ensure consistent test environments both locally and in CI.

#### Running Tests with Docker (Recommended)

```bash
# Build the Docker image
docker build -t saveit-test .

# Run tests in Docker
npm run docker:test

# Run linting in Docker
npm run docker:lint

```

#### Running Tests Locally (without Docker)

```bash
